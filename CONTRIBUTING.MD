-   Helping out with support
    -   [Discord](https://discord.gg/sidestore)
    -   [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/discussions)

However, this guide will focus on the development side of things. For now, we will only have setup information here, but you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/sidestore) if you need help
after setup.
