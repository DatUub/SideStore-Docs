# üèé JIT

JIT allows apps sideloaded with SideStore to enable just-in-time compilation, more commonly known as JIT. JIT allows some apps to run significantly faster ‚Äî or even at all ‚Äî but iOS does not normally allow apps to use JIT for security reasons. SideStore has an in app workaround that allows you to enable JIT for any sideloaded app whenever you are connected to WiFi.

### Enable JIT

#### **SideStore**

1. Open the "My Apps" tab then long-press the app you want to use JIT.
2. Press "Enable JIT" to launch the app, and within a few seconds JIT should be enabled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once enabled, an app can continue using JIT until it is force-quit from the app switcher or purged from memory while suspended in the background.
{% endhint %}
